        <div class="subheading mb-5">UndeclaredðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Diana Carrion, I am 19 years of age, currently attending the University of California, Riverside as an undeclared major. I graduated from Coachella Valley High School with a 3.8 GPA and was involved in about 7 clubs just in my senior year. I was a Associated Student Body (ASB) leader my position was Activities, National Honor Society (Secretary), Gay Straight Alliance (GSA), Si Se Puede, AP Club, SOSA, and Public Service Academy (PSA). I was very involved in my high school going to events, creating those events, and studying for exams. I passed my Spanish AP exam which gave me credits in college before attending. A way I believe I did work hard in high school was because I was given a scholarship and that went towards my college expenses. My community and school gave me many opportunities and after I wish to receive a "well-paying job" I hope to be able to give back and give students who aren't able to access more opportunities.<br><br>

        What I expect to get out of coming to the University of California, Riverside is to educate myself more by learning about more topics and career choices. I am undeclared, but it doesn't mean I am wasting my time because I am currently taking breadth corse classes, which is required for mostly every person in the CHASS department. I decided I wanted my future career to be in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS) department because the majors in this area interested me a bit for than the majors in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences (CNAS) department. I've taken a variety of classes since the first quarter of my freshman year until now my first quarter of my sophomore year. I have taken courses such as English and Math which I have taken before coming to college, but some courses I have never heard of and are new to me. Some courses that I have taken that were new to me are Earthquake Country, were we learn about where earthquakes occur and the different faults and affects they have. Another course that I haven never taken before is Philosophy which is the study of fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. I've learned new things I never would have if I did not attend college after coming from high school. Some people that I know decided not to attend college after graduating and instead get a part time job and would decide later if they still wanted to continue with school, but I believe college helps you not only to find a better paying job than minimum wage, but helps you educate yourself, learn new things, and meet new people. So I would suggest those people to continue school even if its a community college because it is going to be helpful in the future.<br><br>
